# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

This assignment is to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. As a student, I need to select meaningful semantic HTML element to make the site optimize for search engines.


## Table of Contents

* [Search engine optimization](#search-engine-optimization)
* [online reputation management](#online-reputation-management)
* [social media marketing](#social-media-marketing)
* [copyright](#copyright:2019 horiseon)


Installation

1. clone the code from github.
2. download the files into your computer.
3. ready to use.

## Usage

Users can access three sections by clicking on the header of the webpage. There are three subtitles on the header which are "Search Engine Optimization," "Online Reputation Management," and "Secial Media Marketing." 

In "Search Engine Optimization" section, business users will find the right customers through increased visibility.
In "Online Reputation Mangament" section, business owners can avoid unnecessary negative reviews and have better control over what to show to potential customers.
In "Social Media Marketing" section, social media marketing will help users to find the right platform and markets for their business.

On the right side of the webpage, there are "lead generation," "brand awareness," and "cost management."
"Lead generation" is to bring customers directly to user's business.
"Brand awareness" is to increase the visibility of user's business through paid and organic search.
"Cost management" is to decrease the cost of advertisement as the search ranking of the user's ranking increases.

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:
